Getting Started:
==============

To get started with the building process, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

Install the build packages:
===============

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04,16.10,17.04,18.04,18.10,19.04:

```bash
 sudo apt install bc bison build-essential ccache curl flex g++-multilib gcc-multilib git gnupg gperf imagemagick lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-dev lib32z1-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libssl-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush rsync schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev
```
### Getting the source
- Making required directories
- Obtaining the repo binary
- Adding repo binary to your path
- Giving the repo binary proper permissions
- Initializing an empty repo
- Syncing the repo

Alright, so now we’re getting there. I have outlined the basics of what we’re about to do and broke them down as I know them. This is all pretty much going to be copy/paste so it’ll be fairly difficult to screw this up :)

##### Make directory for the repo binary
```bash 
     mkdir ~/bin
```
##### Add directory for the repo binary to its path
```bash 
     PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```
##### Downloading repo binary and placing it in the proper directory

 ```bash 
 curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
 ```

##### Giving the repo binary the proper permissions
```bash 
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
 ```     
To initialize your local repository, use a command like this:

```bash
    repo init -u https://github.com/CherishOS/android_manifest.git -b pixel 
```

Then to sync up:
================

```bash
    repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```
Compilation of Cherish OS:
====================

From root directory of Project, perform following commands in terminal


```bash
. build/envsetup.sh
 brunch device-codename
```
